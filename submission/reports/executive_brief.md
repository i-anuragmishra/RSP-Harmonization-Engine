# RSP Harmonization: Executive Brief

*Date: 2026-02-02*

## The Challenge

Major AI labs have published Responsible Scaling Policies (RSPs) using different:
- **Risk level terminology** (ASL vs CCL vs Tiers)
- **Threshold definitions** for dangerous capabilities
- **Safeguard requirements** at each risk level

This inconsistency creates challenges for regulators and hinders international coordination.

## The Solution

We propose **7 harmonization recommendations** across four areas:

1. **Terminology** (2 recommendations)
2. **Thresholds** (2 recommendations)
3. **Safeguards** (1 recommendations)
4. **Processes** (2 recommendations)

## Top Priority Actions

1. **Unified Risk Level Framework** (HARM-001)
   A unified 5-tier framework provides clearer mapping across existing frameworks while adding granular...

2. **Standardized Autonomy Capability Definition** (HARM-002)
   Breaking down autonomy into specific sub-capabilities allows for more precise thresholds....

3. **CBRN Uplift Measurement Standard** (HARM-003)
   A standardized uplift scale with defined baseline enables consistent assessment across labs....

## Expected Benefits

- **For Regulators:** Clear, comparable standards across all labs
- **For Labs:** Reduced compliance complexity, clearer expectations
- **For Public:** Improved transparency and accountability

## Next Steps

1. Review detailed recommendations
2. Convene stakeholder consultation
3. Develop implementation timeline
4. Coordinate international adoption
